# Firestore Security Rules Documentation

## Overview
This document explains the comprehensive Firestore security rules for the Nigerian Engineering Platform. The rules are designed to provide secure, role-based access control while enabling the Q&A system, study groups, and other platform features.

## Rule Structure

### Helper Functions
```javascript
isAuthenticated()    // User is logged in
isAdmin()           // User has admin role
isLecturer()        // User has lecturer role  
isStudent()         // User has student role
isOwner(userId)     // User owns the resource
```

## Security Features

### üîí Authentication Required
- Most write operations require user authentication
- Public read access for educational content (questions, courses, forums)
- Private access for personal data (notifications, progress, chats)

### üé≠ Role-Based Access Control
- **Students**: Can ask questions, join groups, enroll in courses
- **Lecturers**: Can create courses, manage lessons, moderate content
- **Admins**: Full access to all collections and moderation tools

### üõ°Ô∏è Data Protection
- Users can only edit their own content
- Voting systems prevent manipulation through field-specific updates
- Chat and messages are restricted to participants only
- Reports and analytics are admin-only for privacy

### üîÑ Granular Updates
- Specific field updates allowed for voting, view counts, member counts
- Prevents unauthorized modification of core content
- Maintains data integrity while allowing interactive features

## Deployment

### Deploy Rules
```bash
# Install Firebase CLI
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Deploy rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Or use the deployment script
node deploy-rules.js
```

### Validate Rules
```bash
# Test rules syntax
firebase firestore:rules:validate

# Test with emulator
firebase emulators:start --only firestore
```

## Best Practices

### üîê Security
- Always validate user authentication before writes
- Use role-based permissions for sensitive operations
- Implement proper field-level access control
- Regular security audits and rule reviews

### üìä Performance
- Minimize complex queries in rules
- Use efficient field checks with `affectedKeys()`
- Cache user role data when possible
- Monitor rule evaluation costs

### üß™ Testing
- Test rules with Firebase emulator
- Create comprehensive test cases for all scenarios
- Validate edge cases and error conditions
- Regular penetration testing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Permission Denied**: Check user authentication and role
2. **Rule Evaluation Failed**: Validate rule syntax
3. **Infinite Recursion**: Avoid circular references in rules
4. **Performance Issues**: Optimize complex rule conditions

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check current rules
firebase firestore:rules:get

# Test specific rule
firebase firestore:rules:test

# View rule evaluation logs
firebase firestore:rules:debug
```
